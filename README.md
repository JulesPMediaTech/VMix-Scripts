**Welcome to my scripts for the VMIX streaming application**

Vmix is one of the best live streaming applications on the market at this time. It is well-featured, well-supported, versatile and logical. It's great to use, particularly with Bitfocus Companion and the Elgado Streamdeck configurable soft button controller. However, like anything, there are one or two elements that could be improved. Being an audio guy, this is the area where my gripes are.

Lack of pre-fade sends to audio output busses. Although, unlike a lot of other streaming applications, at least it has busses.

Crappy fader resolution. All you get is effectively 0-100.

Faders display volume as logarithmic % and dB but if you want to enter a volume level via a shortcut you're back to the meaningless linear 0-100 scale. I have created a script to get round this issue.

No audio fades! The only way you can do it is by using the Fade To Black control. Not ideal. ...UNTIL NOW....
